# tree-sitter-pug

**WARNING** This parser is incomplete and in it's very early stages. Will most likely break if you attempt to use it on any real code.

This is a tree-sitter parser for the [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) language.
For now this is intended to be used for a vue+pug setup, as the control flow operations aren't recognized by the parser (since they are not used in conjunction with vue).
